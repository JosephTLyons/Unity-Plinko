## Gameplay

In order to play the game, you simply need to run the application, for either Windows or macOS.

Artwork including the ball, peg, left and right walls, and paddle, was created by me using [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) software.
The background image was a stock image I found at [PhotosInbox](http://photosinbox.com/textures/light-wood-texture).

All sounds were discovered and downloaded from [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org), my go-to website for free sounds for any project.
