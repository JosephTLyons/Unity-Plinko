In order to play the game, you simply need to run the application, for either Windows or macOS.

Artwork including the ball, peg, left and right walls, and paddle, was done by me using Pixelmator software.
The background image was a stock image I found at PhotosInbox.com: http://photosinbox.com/textures/light-wood-texture

All sounds were discovered and downloaded from http://www.freesound.org, my go-to website for free sounds for any project.
